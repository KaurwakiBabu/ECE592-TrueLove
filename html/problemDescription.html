<h1>True Love</h1>

<p>In the original version of the project a drone caries a love letter from one person to another. To avoid any close encounters between the drone and the said persons, let's instead have the drone pick up the love letter from a pick-up point and deliver it to the target destination. Both the pickup point and target destination will be marked visually rather than provided as GPS coordinates. The pickup and drop-off can be done in any way you want (e.g., loop and hook, magnetic, etc.).
