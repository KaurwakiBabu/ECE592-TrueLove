  <h2> Letter Weight </h2> <br>
  <p> One thing our group quickly noticed during our first field test, and unfortunately the demonstration day, was that our letter and metal hook object was light enough to be blown away by the drone propellers as the drone neared the object. <br>
  For obvious reasons, this was problematic as one key object of our project was to pick-up the lever using the drone's payload. We would recommend that future teams ensure their letter / object is heavy enough to not be blown away, but light enough to be lifted by the drone. <br>
