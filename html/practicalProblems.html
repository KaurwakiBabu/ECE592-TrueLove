  <h1> Practical Problems </h1>

  <h2> 3D Printings </h2>
    <p> Using NC State resources to make free 3D prints is a great way to try different payload designs and iterations. The key recommendation here is starting early so you can make changes 
    and re-print if necessary.</p>
  <h2> Gazebo and ROS Simulation </h2>
  <p> We had significant difficulty downloading Gazebo and ROS onto our personal devices for virtual drone testing. While SITL was adequate for tracking general movement, we wanted to use Gazebo and ROS to test the image processing and lidar functionality. Not only does ROS require a very specific
    version of Ubuntu, but the integration between Gazebo and ROS is incredibly complicated to get functional. Assuming future groups have similar difficulties, we would recommend 
    finding opportunities to test in the field before Demo Day so you can fine-tune functionality. 
  </p>
  <h2> Letter Weight </h2> 
  <p> One thing our group quickly noticed during our first field test, and unfortunately, the demonstration day, was that our letter and metal hook object was light enough to be blown away by the drone propellers as the drone neared the object. 
  For obvious reasons, this was problematic as one key component of our project was to pick up the lever using the drone's payload. We would recommend that future teams ensure their letter/object is heavy enough to not be blown away, but light enough to be lifted by the drone.
